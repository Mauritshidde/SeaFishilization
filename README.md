#sea Fishilization
Sea Fishilazition is a game we made for the Fish Fest game jam.  
We made this game using c++ and Raylib.


Installing game:
you can download the game from itch.io using this link: https://mauritshidde.itch.io/sea-fishilization

Installing github project
If you want to compile the code you need to have raylib, the makefile only compiles non staticly for linux.
There is also a makefile which compiles for windows staticly, whcih can also be used for linux but it will be slower, becasue it will run with wine.
